 Cloud Reliability Team Project

<p align='center'>This repo contains the files for my final project at Makers Academy as part of the Cloud/DevOps Engineering specialism track.</p>

## Project Overview

In this project, our team was commissioned by a organization that delivers software and services to several veterinary hospitals. Our primary goal was to enhance the reliability of their existing application, HOSP, while ensuring its core functionality remained intact. Additionally, we undertook the responsibility of implementing various improvements and incorporating new features to elevate the overall user experience.


## The system
The application is called HOSP and unfortunately we didnt have access to the source code, we did have access to its load balancer and the API documentation.</br>
