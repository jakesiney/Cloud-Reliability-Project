 Cloud Reliability Team Project
</h1>

<p align='center'>This repo contains the files for my final project at Makers Academy as part of the Cloud/DevOps Engineering specailism track.</p>

## The task
During this project my team and I were hired by an orginisation that provides software and services to a number of veterinary hospitals.

We were tasked with preserving the functionality of the system while increasing it's reliabilty and implementing improvements and new features.


## The system
The application is called HOSP and unfortunately we didnt have access to the source code, we did have access to its load balancer and the API documentation.</br>
